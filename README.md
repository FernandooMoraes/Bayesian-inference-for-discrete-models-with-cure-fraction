# Bayesian-inference-for-discrete-models-with-cure-fraction

The present work was carried out as a requirement for the completion of the Bayesian Inference discipline
offered by the Interinstitutional Graduate Program in Statistics at UFSCar-USP (PIPGEs).

Application 1: Melanoma

This application models a data set that depicts a clinical study in which patients were observed for recurrence after the removal of a malignant melanoma between 1991 and 1998.
Melanoma is a malignant tumor that can appear on the skin, mucous membranes, eyes and in the central nervous system, with a great risk of producing metastases and high rates of
mortality in the later stages. The data set has 417 observations with a maximum time of 7 years and the patient's death is considered the event of interest.
A more detailed description of these data can be found in Ibrahim et al. (2001).


Application 2: Bladder Cancer

This application models a set of data described in the R software survival package that depicts a bladder cancer study, where all of its patients had tumors
superficial bladder when they started the study, these being removed and patients randomly assigned to one of three types of treatments: placebo, thiotepa and pyridoxine.
For the study, a total of 85 individuals were assigned to thiotepa or placebo, and who had only four tumor recurrences.
